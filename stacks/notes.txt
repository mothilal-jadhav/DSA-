A stack is linear Data Structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed.

It follows the first in last out (FILO).

it is more like elements are arranged in verical order in a closest and we remove the top most element which obviously will be the last element we push into the stack

the main operations that we can use are :

1. push
2. pop
3. peek

the use cases of stack are:

1. finding next or previous greatest element
2. finding next or previous smaller element
3. stock spans/ histogram problems
4. iterative tower of hentai problem
