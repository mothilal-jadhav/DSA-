A stack is linear Data Structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed.

It follows the first in last out (FILO).

it is more like elements are arranged in verical order in a closest and we remove the top most element which obviously will be the last element we push into the stack

the main operations that we can use are :

1. push()
2. pop()
3. top()
4. isEmpty()
5. size()

the use cases of stack are:

1. finding next or previous greatest element
2. finding next or previous smaller element
3. stock spans/ histogram problems
4. iterative tower of hentai problem

Basic Terminologies of Stack:

1. top - operations like push and pop are performed at the top of the Stack
2. size - refers to the current number of elements present in the stack

Types of Stack:

1. Fixed Size Stack

a fixed size stack has predefined capacity, once it is full then no element can be added or else it will overflow and if a stack is empty and we try to pop an element them it causes underflow
this can be implemented using static array

2. Dynamic Size Stack

a Dynamic size stack can be grow or shrink based on the operations performed, if stack is full then its capacity increases as elements are added and memory usage shrinks as elements are removed
can be implemented using dynamic array or linked list. 

we generally use dynamic size as it does not cause the overflow problem

Advantages of stack are:

1. It is very simple and easy to understand and implement
2. It is very efficient in terms of time complexity, takes only O(1) time for insertion, deletion and peeking at top element
