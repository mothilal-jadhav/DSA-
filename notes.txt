linked list allows us to have efficient insertion and deletion compared to arrays. in case of arrays the elements were stored in form of contiguous memeory 
and if there is a case where i had to declare a fixed size array and then i dont use it then the memeory is wasted or else if i want ti insert elements beyond their capacity then it is not allowed.

we can also use the dynamic arrays where appending and removing are easier by in built functions but they take O(n) time. instead we can use linked list 

Linked list are of three types mainly : 
-> Singly linked list 
-> Doubly lined list
-> Circular linked list


in a Singly linked list the memory is stored at a specific location not related to other elements memory location. every element is located at a differet locations and all the address of their location are stored as a value and connected through a node and pointer

Linked list can be represented as : [2|-]->[3|-]->[4|-]->[5|-]-> Null
for a linked list are nothing but nodes connected with links. node consists of two parameters 1. Data 2. Next

the first node is called as Head Node and we can traverse the linked list using Next link

Linked List:
Data Structure: Non-contiguous
Memory Allocation: Typically allocated one by one to individual elements
Insertion/Deletion: Efficient
Access: Sequential


Array:
Data Structure: Contiguous
Memory Allocation: Typically allocated to the whole array
Insertion/Deletion: Inefficient
Access: Random
