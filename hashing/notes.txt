Hashing is a technique used for storing and accessing the data efficiently 

Hashing involves in mapping data to a specific index in a hash table using hash function. it enables fast retrival of information based on its key

the best thing about hashing is we can perform actions like searching, inserting, and deltion in O(1) time on average

hashing is mainly used for implementing a set of distinct elements(keys) and dictionaries(key value pair)

let the list l = [1,2,3,6,8]

hash function be h(x) = x%10 

then our hash table will be = [0,1,2,3,0,6,8,0] now we can access 8 in O(1) time we dont need O(n) time as in case of array

if i have a element say 11 then it will go for index 1 but the issue is there is already a element present 

to counter this problem we can do :
