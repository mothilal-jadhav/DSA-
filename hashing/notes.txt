Hashing is a technique used for storing and accessing the data efficiently 

Hashing involves in mapping data to a specific index in a hash table using hash function. it enables fast retrival of information based on its key

the best thing about hashing is we can perform actions like searching, inserting, and deltion in O(1) time on average

hashing is mainly used for implementing a set of distinct elements(keys) and dictionaries(key value pair)

let the list l = [1,2,3,6,8]

hash function be h(x) = x%10 

then our hash table will be = [0,1,2,3,0,0,6,0,8,0] now we can access 8 in O(1) time we dont need O(n) time as in case of array

if i have a element say 11 then it will go for index 1 but the issue is there is already a element present 

to counter this problem we can do : 

-> seperate chaining : 
one of the most popular and commonly used techniques in order to handle collisions
The idea behind separate chaining is to implement the array as a linked list called a chain

Linked List or a Dynamic Sized Array is used to implement this technique. 
So when multiple elements are hashed into the same slot index, then these elements are inserted into a singly-linked list which is known as a chain. 

for example i append elements like 11,21,31,41 then all these will give a remainder of 1 which will hash at 1st index and numbers like 38, 53,66,23 will take indexes betweem 0-9, hence the hash table will become 

[
    0
    1 -> 11 -> 21 -> 31 -> 41
    2
    3 -> 53 -> 23
    0
    0
    6 -> 66
    0
    8 -> 38
    0
]

the traditional array would have been like [1,2,3,6,8,11,21,31,41,38,53,66,23]

now searching numbers like 23 or 38 would take a lot of time in array but in hash table, we check in the index, if element is there then true else we will search the linked list chained to that index which would be O(n) for worst case but will be better than array
