A linked list is a fundamental data structure in computer science. It mainly allows efficient insertion and deletion operations compared to arrays. Like arrays, it is also used to implement other data structures like stack, queue and deque.

A linked list is a type of linear data structure individual items are not necessarily at contiguous locations. The individual items are called nodes and connected with each other using links.

A node contains two things first is data and second is a link that connects it with another node.
The first node is called the head node and we can traverse the whole list using this head and next links.


Linked List:
Data Structure: Non-contiguous
Memory Allocation: Typically allocated one by one to individual elements
Insertion/Deletion: Efficient
Access: Sequential


Array:
Data Structure: Contiguous
Memory Allocation: Typically allocated to the whole array
Insertion/Deletion: Inefficient
Access: Random
