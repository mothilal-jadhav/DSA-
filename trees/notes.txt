Tree Data Structure is a non linear data Structure where elements are collected via edges and stored in nodes such that there exists only one path between any nodes


                                                (A)         -> level 0
                                                /  \
                                              (B)   (C)     -> level 1
                                              / \    / \  
                                            (D) (E) (F) (G) -> level 2


A -> Root
D E F G -> Leaf Nodes
D E -> siblings
F G -> siblings

B & D -> parent and child Nodes
B & E -> parent and child Nodes

B D E -> a sub tree where B acts as root 


Types of trees:

1. Binary Tree
2. Ternary Tree
3. N -ary Tree
