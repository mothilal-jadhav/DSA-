Tree Data Structure is a non linear data Structure where elements are collected via edges and stored in nodes such that there exists only one path between any nodes
A tree is a hierarchical data structure used to organize and represent data in a parent–child relationship.
It consists of nodes, where the topmost node is called the root, and every other node can have one or more child nodes.




                                                (A)         -> level 0
                                                /  \
                                              (B)   (C)     -> level 1

                                            (D) (E) (F) (G) -> level 2          height of this tree is 2.


A -> Root
D E F G -> Leaf Nodes
D E -> siblings
F G -> siblings

B & D -> parent and child Nodes
B & E -> parent and child Nodes

B D E -> a sub tree where B acts as root 


Types of trees:

1. Binary Tree
2. Ternary Tree
3. N -ary Tree

Basic Terms In Tree Data Structure:

-> Parent Node: A node that is an immediate predecessor of another node. Example: B is the parent of D and E.
-> Child Node: A node that is an immediate successor of another node. Example: D and E are children of B.
-> Root Node: The topmost node in a tree, which does not have a parent. Example: A is the root node.
-> Leaf Node (External Node): Nodes that do not have any children. Example: D E F G are leaf nodes.
-> Ancestor: Any node on the path from the root to a given node (excluding the node itself). Example: A and B are ancestors of D.
-> Descendant: A node x is a descendant of another node y if y is an ancestor of x. Example: F and G are descendants of A.
-> Sibling: Nodes that share the same parent. Example: F and G are siblings, and D and E are siblings.
-> Level of a Node: The number of edges in the path from the root to that node.The root node is at level 0.
-> Internal Node: A node with at least one child.
-> Neighbor of a Node: The parent or children of a node.
-> Subtree:  A node and all its descendants form a subtree.


Importance of Tree Data Structure:

-> Trees are useful for storing data that naturally forms a hierarchy.
-> File systems on computers are structured as trees, with folders containing subfolders and files.
-> The DOM (Document Object Model) of an HTML page is a tree:The <html> tag is the root.<head> and <body> are its children.These tags can have their own child nodes, forming a hierarchical structure.
-> Trees help in efficient data organization and retrieval for hierarchical relationships.


Properties of Tree Data Structure:

-> Number of edges: An edge is the connection between two nodes. A tree with N nodes will always have N - 1 edges. There is exactly one path from any node to any other node in the tree.
-> Depth of a node: The depth of a node is the length of the path from the root to that node. Each edge in the path adds 1 unit to the length. Equivalently, it is the number of edges from the root to the node.
-> Height of the tree: The height of the tree is the length of the longest path from the root to any leaf node.
-> Degree of a node: The degree of a node is the number of subtrees attached to it.
   A leaf node has a degree of 0.
   The degree of the root is the maximum degree among all nodes in the tree.
