Queue is a Data Structure that is used to store and operate data in First In First Out (FIFO)

It can be understood like standing in a queue for movie tickets and the person who came first will have the ticket and gets out of the queue

difference b/w stack and queue is in stack elements are stored vertically and we can only access the top element where as in queue elements are stored in horizontal position and we can only access the element that is first.

Basic Terminologies of Queue:

1. Front - the front position of the queue that is ready to be served when removed, it is called as head of the queue
2. Rear - the rear position of the queue that is added recently and called as tail of the queue
3. size - current no of elements in the queue
4. capacity - maximum no of elements queue can hold

Types of Queue:
1. Simple Queue
2. Double Ended Queue - (i) Input restricted Queue (ii) Output restricted Queue
3. Priority Queue - (i) Ascending Priority Queue (ii) Descending Priority Queue

Simple Queue

A simple Queue follows the FIFO principle:
-> insertion is allowed only at the rear 
-> deletion is allowed only at the front
-> can be implemented using a linked list or a circular array


Double Queue (dequeue)

In a Dequeue insertion and deletion is performed at both the ends

Priority Queue 

in this queue elements are assigned a priority and deletion happens on the basis of priority not on the position

Operations:
-> enqueue()
-> dequeue()
-> peek()
-> size()
-> isEmpty()
-> isFull()

Applications of queue:
-> Job scheduling
-> cpu scheduling
-> networking
-> buffer management

Queue can be implemented using array (both fixed and dynamic) 

we can implement queue using dynamic array by maintaining only front pointer. the front pointer tracks the first element of the queue

enqueue can be done by inserting the element at the next avilable position at the end. no rear pointer is needed

dequeue can be done by removing the first element and incrementing the front pointer

The space before front is never reused, and unlike basic array implementations, we do not shift elements after each dequeue. 
This ensures both enqueue and dequeue operations run in O(1) time with a simple design.

so the limitations for this method will be lot of memory wastage and infinite memory assumptions where as memory is always finite.
